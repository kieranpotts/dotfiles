Use this issue to suggest changes to source code and configuration that will improve **external** quality attributes of the software system such as its performance, security, availability, scalability and portability.

If possible, the target quality attributes should be specified as measurable non-functional requirements. Can you specify metrics against which the software can be benchmarked? Examples include Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Mean Time to Recover/Repair (MTTR), the application's crash rate and time to recovery, the open/close rates of incidents, and even user analytics such as shopping cart abandonment rate.

Alternatively, it may be possible to define acceptance criteria in terms of conformance to published standards, such as the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (for encrypting sensitive data in storage), 256-bit SSL/TLS encryption (for data in transit), Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (for usability), and the EU General Data Protection Regulations (for the handling of personally-identifiable data).

This category of work should not be confused with refactoring, which is concerned with improving a computer program's **internal** quality attributes – its code and structure – for easier development and maintenance.
