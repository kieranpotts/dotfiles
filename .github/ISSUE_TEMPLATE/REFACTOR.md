Use this template to suggest how the structure and design of the source code and configuration can be changed in such as way that it will make the system easier to maintain and develop further. The proposed changes should not impact the external behavior or interfaces of the program. This category of work is focused on the needs of the developers and maintainers of the software system, rather than its owners or users. Technical debt is a popular metaphor for explaining the value of refactoring.

Consider the short-term costs and potential risks versus the longer-term benefits to be gained by implementing the proposed changes.

Is there any data that can be auto-generated to measure the impact of these changes, such as a reduction in the number of lines of code or changes to metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity and NPath?
