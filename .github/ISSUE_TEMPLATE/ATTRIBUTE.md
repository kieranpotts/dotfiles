Suggest changes to source code and configuration that will improve quality attributes of the software system such as its performance, security, availability, scalability and portability.

If possible, the target quality attributes should be specified as measurable non-functional requirements. Can you specify metrics against which the software can be benchmarked? Examples include Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Mean Time to Recover/Repair (MTTR), the application's crash rate and time to recovery, the open/close rates of incidents, and even user analytics such as shopping cart abandonment rate.

Alternatively, it may be possible to define acceptance criteria in terms of conformance to published standards, such as 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (for encrypting sensitive data in storage), 256-bit SSL/TLS encryption (for data in transit), Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) grading, and conformance to the EU General Data Protection Regulations standard (GDPR) for the handling of personally-identifiable data.
