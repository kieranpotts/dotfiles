Report a suspected bug in the software system under source control. 

Bugs are errors or regressions in the expected behavior of a computer program, either in its functionality and behaviors or in terms of its attributes such as performance and availability. Software bugs are caused by mistakes in the business logic of production code or configuration, causing the program to behave in unintended ways, to produce incorrect results, or to otherwise not work as specified.

If possible, provide easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions to reproduce the error, for example:

1. Go to ...
2. Click on ...
3. Scroll down to ...

Expected outcome: ...

Actual outcome: ...

Please also tell us the runtime environments in which you installed the dotfiles, and which terminal program you are using. Include any other relevant materials such as screenshots or the stderr output. Is there any other context you can provide that will help the project's maintainers to reproduce the error?
