Use this issue to report a suspected bug in the software system.

Bugs are errors or regressions in the expected behavior of a computer program, either in terms of its functionality and behaviors or its non-functional attributes such as performance and availability, discovered in production. Bugs are caused by changes in a program's business logic or its configuration, causing the system to behave in unintended ways, to produce incorrect results, or to otherwise not work as specified.

If possible, provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce the error, for example:

```txt
1. Go to …
2. Click on …
3. Scroll down to …

Expected outcome: …

Actual outcome: …
```

Please also tell us the runtime environments in which you installed the software or, for remote services, which devices and systems you are using to access it. Include any other relevant materials such as screenshots or the stderr output. Is there any further context you can provide that will help the project's maintainers to replicate the error?
