Use this issue to suggest how the code and structure of the system can be changed to make it easier to further develop and maintain.

Good architecture and clean code is the foundation on which high quality systems are built. Refactoring will ultimately benefit the users and owners of the software, for example through faster delivery of features, greater robustness and higher scalability. But the focus of this work is on the needs of the developers and maintainers of the software.

Technical debt (aka design debt) is a popular metaphor for explaining the value of refactoring to organizations that pay the development bills.

Consider the short-term costs and potential risks versus the longer-term benefits to be gained by implementing the proposed changes. Is there any data that can be generated to measure the impact of these changes, such as extensions to test coverage, reductions in the number of lines of code, or improvements to code complexity metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity or NPath?
