Use this issue to specify new or modified functionality, or to propose that existing operations or behaviors be deprecated, removed or superseded. Please describe which users this feature will impact, and if there are alternative solutions you've considered.

Software features can be classified into two types: functional and non-functional. Functional features provide specific capabilities to the user, such as a word processor's ability to auto-save changes. This category of work includes changes to external interfaces (APIs, CLIs, GUIsâ€¦) and to internal processes, algorithms and persistence that will alter what the system does. Non-functional features, also called quality attributes, are characteristics of the software that impact the user's experience of using it, such as performance, reliability and accessibility.
