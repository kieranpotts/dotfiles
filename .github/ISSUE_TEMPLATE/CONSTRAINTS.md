Use this issue to define changes to constraints within which the system is required to operate. A constraint may be any external quality attribute of the system that impacts the user's experience of it. Examples include speed, security and availability.

Constraints are also known as non-functional requirements.

If possible, specify metrics against which the system can be benchmarked, such as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Mean Time to Recover/Repair (MTTR), or the application's crash rate and time to recovery. More indirect measurements such as the open/close rates of incidents, and even user analytics such as shopping cart abandonment rate, may also be useful.

Alternatively, it may be possible to define acceptance criteria in terms of conformance to published standards, such as the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (for encrypting sensitive data in storage), 256-bit SSL/TLS encryption (for data in transit), Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (for usability), and the EU General Data Protection Regulations (for the handling of personally-identifiable data).
