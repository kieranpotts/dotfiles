Use this issue to log general maintenance work that needs to be undertaken.

Maintenance work covers any routine housekeeping tasks and general upkeep of the software system. This category of work includes the upgrading of dependencies and changes to configuration of tools and infrastructure. It also includes changes to other artifacts under source control such as documentation, requirements specifications and test scripts.

In some cases maintenance work may involve some refactoring of source code and configuration, for example to maintain compatibility with breaking API changes in updated dependencies.
