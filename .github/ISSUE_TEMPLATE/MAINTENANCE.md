Log general maintenance work that needs to be undertaken.

Maintenance includes the upgrading of dependencies and changes to configuration. It also includes changes to supporting materials under source control such as documentation, specification requirements and test scripts. Trivial changes, such as fixing typos in READMEs, fall into this category of work, too.

In some cases maintenance work may involve making changes to source code and configuration, for example to maintain compatibility with breaking API changes in dependencies.
