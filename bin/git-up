# Git alias to push commits and tags to the upstream "origin" repository. Setup
# branch tracking if it is not already established.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git up
# ```
#
# This command assumes that the tracked upstream branch will always have
# an identical name to the local one.
#
# See also the `git down` alias, with mirrors this one, and `git sync`,
# which combines the two into a single operation.
