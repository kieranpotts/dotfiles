# Git alias to update local objects and refs (ie branches and tags) to match
# all remotes.
#
# This command also removes any refs from the local repository that no longer
# exist in any remote, including tags. Careful, any tags newly-created in the
# downstream repository will be deleted unless they have been already pushed
# upstream. Local branches will not be deleted, however – only references to
# branches in the upstream repository are deleted.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git download
# ```
# ==============================================================================

git fetch --all --tags --prune --prune-tags
