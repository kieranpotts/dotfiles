# Git alias to undo the last commit, discarding the commit object but re-staging
# the commit's changes, ready for re-commit.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git uncommit
# ```
#
# Combine with `git undo` to fully delete the changes. Running both commands,
# `git uncommit && git undo`, is equivalent to doing `git reset HEAD~1 --hard`.
# ==============================================================================

git reset HEAD~1 --soft
