# Git alias to undo a prior `git commit --amend` operation.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git unamend
# ```
#
# If you have amended the previous commit (`git commit --amend`), this will
# undo the amend operation, leaving the commit in its original state before
# it was amended.
#
# The amendements will be returned to the staging index (`--soft`).
#
# If the previous operation was NOT an amend, the behavior of this command
# will be identical to the `git uncommit` alias.
# ==============================================================================

git reset HEAD@{1} --soft
