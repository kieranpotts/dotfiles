# Git alias for getting the name of the default branch in the upstream
# repository.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git default
# ```
#
# This alias parses the local `origin/HEAD` reference, which points to the
# name of the default branch in the upstream "origin" repository.
#
# WARNING: The `origin/HEAD` ref can become out-of-date. It is set when you
# `git clone` the upstream repository, and is not subsequently updated - it
# is not changed by commands like `git fetch` or `git remote update`.
# Therefore, if the default branch is subsequently changed in the reference
# repository, it will need to be manually updated in all the clones for
# this alias to work correctly.
#
# The easiest way to update the `origin/HEAD` ref is to run the following
# command in the local repository. This command updates local knowledge of
# what the remote considers to be the default branch.
#
# ```
# git remote set-head origin --auto|-a
# ```
#
# (NOTE: Prior to Git v1.8, the above command could set the `origin/HEAD` ref
# incorrectly, due to potential ambiguity over what is the default branch when
# the upstream `HEAD` referenes a commit SHA that is at the tip of more than
# one branch. This issue is now resolved in Git and we can rely on `git clone`
# and the above command setting `origin/HEAD` correctly in clones.)
#
# Alternatively, you can manually edit your `.git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
# file. If your default branch is named "dev", the contents of this file
# should be:
#
# ```
# ref: refs/remotes/origin/dev
# ```
