# Git alias to list all branches by order of last commit.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git branches
# ```
#
# This is an alternative to `git branch`. It has nicer formatting and the
# ordering is more useful. The most-recently revised branches are at the
# bottom of the list.
# ==============================================================================

# Sort by last commit date, newest first.
