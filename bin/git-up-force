# Git alias to force-push changes up to the remote.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git force
# ```
#
# The `--force` flag should never be used against shared branches. The similar
# `--force-with-lease` option is a little bit safer – it _partially_ protects
# against destructive pushes. What it does is check that the downstream
# branch has all the commits that exist in the upstream one, and therefore
# we can be more confident that we will not overwrite work that other people
# have committed there. But it is not a perfect failsafe. For example,
# `--force-with-lease` will delete upstream commits when the downstream
# repository has been updated with `git fetch` and not a subsequent `git merge`
# (or a `git pull`, which combines both operations). See the following
# Atlassian article for more bakcground to the dangers of force pushing:

# ==============================================================================

# TODO: Consider integrating this with `git up`. If `git up` fails, the user
# should be prompted if they would like to try a forced push.

git push --set-upstream origin HEAD --follow-tags --force-with-lease
