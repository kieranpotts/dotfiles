# ==============================================================================
# Git alias for quickly saving work-in-progress.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git wip ("[comment]")
# ```
#
# The provided comment will be suffixed " - WIP". If no comment is provided
# the commit message will be "WIP".
#
# The purpose of this alias is to allow quick saving and backing up (to a
# remote repository) of work-in-progress. WIP commits are expected to be
# reset and their contents restored to the working tree the next time the 
# developer continues to work from the current branch. The `git restore` 
# alias provides a shortcut for doing exactly this.
# ==============================================================================

git add --all

# If there's an environment variable called `X_GIT_COMMIT_VERIFY` and its value
# is `0`, then we apply the `--no-verify` flag to the `git commit` operation.
VERIFY=${X_GIT_COMMIT_VERIFY:-1}

if [ "$VERIFY" -eq "0" ]; then
  git commit --quiet --no-verify --message "${1:-WIP}${1+ - WIP}"
else
  git commit --quiet --message "${1:-WIP}${1+ - WIP}"
