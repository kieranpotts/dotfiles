# Git alias to delete any local branches that have been merged into the default
# branch, or that have been merged into another specified mainline branch.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git fell ([main-branch])
# ```
#
# It works like this:
#
# 1. Get a list of branches that have been merged into the specified branch,
#    falling back on the default branch if there are no parameters.
# 2. Use `grep -v` to print a list of branch names that DO NOT match the
#    name of the target branch branch.
# 3. Pipe this to `xargs`, which takes the standard input and executes the
#    command `git branch --delete` for each line.
# 4. In the event that all branches have been merged, the `branch --delete`
#    operation will error with the message "fatal: branch name required".
#    We can safely silence this output to stderr.
#
# This alias does not delete any corresponding upstream branches. This would
# be a too-dangerous operation to automate, in case there are other shared
# mainline tracks besides the default branch.
