# Git alias to untrack a specific file.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git untrack [path]
# ```
#
# The `rm` command combined with the `--cache` option removes a file from the
# staging index but maintains the file in the working tree. When the next
# commit is made, the untracked file(s) will be removed from the repository,
# but not deleted from the local filesystem.
#
# Usage: `git untrack path/to/file.ext`
#
# See also `git ignore`, which permanently removes the file path from the index.
#
# See:
# - https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rm
