# Git alias to permanently keep local changes to a file path out of Git's 
# staging index.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git ignore [path]
# ```
#
# This alias uses the `git update-index` operation to tell Git to assume that any
# changes made to the path can be ignored. This can be useful, for example, for 
# making local-specific changes to environment configuration files that are
# checked in to source control. But this operation should be used sparingly, and
# be aware that unexpected behaviors can arise with other operations such as
# `git stash`.
#
# Usage: `git ignore path/to/file.ext`
#
# Use `git unignore [path]` to undo this operation, and `git ignored` to list all 
# the paths that are currently ignored.
#
# See also `git track`/`git untrack`, which is a similar operation but temporary
# and safer.
#
# See:
# - https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-update-index.html
