# Git alias to delete both the local and upstream versions of branch, succeeding
# only if the branches have been merged.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git delete ([branch])
# ```
#
# This is a safe delete operation. It will succeed only if the commits in the
# branch exist in other branches â€“ in other words, the branch will be deleted
# only if it does not contain any unique commits.
#
# The `push` operation will fail if remote tracking is not established for
# the branch, and we can safely ignore that error as it just means there is
# no upstream version of the branch to delete.
