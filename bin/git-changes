# Script for showing all changes in a Git repository since the last commit,
# including both staged and unstaged (working) changes.
#
# See also `git-staged`, which lists only staged changes, and `git-working`,
# which lists unstaged changes.
#
# If a commit hash is provided as an input parameter, this command will
# instead list the files that were committed with changes in the given
# commit. See also `git-last`, a shortcut for showing details information on
# changes introduced in the last commit.
