# ==============================================================================
# Git alias to show all changes introduced to a Git repository since the last
# commit, including both staged and unstaged/working changes.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git changes ([hash])
# ```
#
# See also `git-staged`, which lists only staged changes, and `git-working`,
# which lists only unstaged/working changes.
#
# If a commit hash is provided as an input parameter, this command will instead
# list all the files that were committed with changes in the given commit. See
# also `git-last`, which is a shortcut for showing the changes introduced in
# the last commit.
