# ==============================================================================
# Script for showing all changes in a Git repository since the last commit,
# including both staged and unstaged (working) changes. This command lists
# the names of files that contain changes, and the status of each: Added,
# Modified or Deleted.
#
# See also `git-staged`, which lists only staged changes, and `git-working`,
# which lists unstaged changes.
#
# If a commit hash is provided as an input parameter, this command will
# instead list the files that were committed with changes in the given
# commit.
#
# See `~/.gitconfig` for usage instructions.
