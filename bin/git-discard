# Git alias to discard working changes made to one or more files since the last
# commit.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git discard [file1] [file2]...
# ```
#
# This is equivalent of the undo operation in VSCode's built-in Git GUI.
#
# Multiple file paths may be inputted, but additional options are not accepted
# (they are disabled by the double hyphen `--` which marks the start of the
# file list).
#
# This is a destructive operation. If you accidentally discard working
# changes, they cannot be retrieved.
# ==============================================================================

# TODO: Use same SAVEPOINT strategy as for `git undo`?
