# Git alias to create a new branch with no parents. All files in the working
# tree will be added to the staging index, from where they can be removed or
# edited further before the first commit is made to the new branch.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git orphan ([branch-name])
# ```
#
# Note: unlike the branching aliases, the new branch cannot be immediately
# synced with the upstream reference repository. That's because, until there is
# at least one commit in the orphaned branch's history, there is no HEAD
# reference.
# ==============================================================================

# TODO: Combine this with `git orphan`. If there are working/staged changes, 
# prompt the use to keep or discard them.
