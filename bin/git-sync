# ==============================================================================
# Git alias that combines `pull` and `push` operations to sync the current
# checked out Git branch with the upstream branch it tracks.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git sync
# ```
#
# The behavior of this alias is equivalent to VS Code's branch syncing
# operation, and it is equivalent to chaining the `git down &&  git up`
# aliases. By using the rebasing strategy on `pull`, it maintains a
# linear commit history even if there is divergent work between the local
# and upstream branches.
#
# `git pull --rebase` will fail if the local branch does not yet track an
# upstream branch. So this command is run only if tracking is already
# established for the branch. If it is, the existing tracking is maintained –
# this supports the local and tracked upstream branches having different names.
#
# If tracking is not yet established for the local branch, only a `push` is
# done. The local branch is pushed to a branch of the same name in the
# "origin" remote, and tracking is established for next time.
#
# Anything in the staging index plus working changes (including new as-yet
# untracked files) are temporarily stashed. (We check the stash counts to make
# sure we don't reapply work that was stashed earlier.) By temporarily
# stashing work-in-progress we can pull remote updates into a dirty local
# tree.
#
# This command works only after an initial commit has been made to the local
# repository.
