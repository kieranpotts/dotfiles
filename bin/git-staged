# Git alias to show files that have changes staged for committing.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git staged
# ```
#
# See also the `git-working` script, which lists files with unstaged changes in
# the repository's working tree, and `git-changes`, which lists all files
# changed since the last commit, whether or not those changes have been staged.
