# Git alias to undo all working and staged changes since the last commit.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git undo
# ```
#
# A simple but dangerous operation would be:
#
# ```
# reset --hard
# ```
#
# The effects of this operation could not be undone. The solution is to commit
# all work-in-progress with the message "--SAVEPOINT--" then hard-reset the
# branch to the prior commit. The "--SAVEPOINT--" commit is removed from the
# branch's history but is still reachable via `git reflog`, and can therefore
# be restored if a mistake was made with the reset.
#
# Following the `reset` with the `clean -fd` command will also remove
# untracked files recursively throughout the working tree. So the net effect
# of these two commands is to completely blow away all changes made since the
# last commit, but with the option to undo the undo!!
