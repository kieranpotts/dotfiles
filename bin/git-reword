# Git alias to change the message of the previous commit.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```
# git reword
# ```
#
# Note: while this operation does not stage anything, files already staged will
# be added to the previous commit, too.
#
# This also changes the hash of the previous commit, so the change may need to
# be force-pushed into remotes that have the existing commit.
