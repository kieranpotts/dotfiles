# The `.gitignore` file tells the Git version control system what content on the
# local filesystem should not be tracked.
#
# Files that may exist within a code repository but that should – generally – be
# excluded from source control include machine-generated files and any artifacts
# that can be derived from the source code.
#
# GitHub provides a collection of useful `.gitignore` templates for a variety of
# software stacks here: https://github.com/github/gitignore
