# ==============================================================================
# The `~/.profile` file is a user-scoped startup script for interactive logins
# to all shell environments â€“ Bash, Fish, Zsh, etc.

# This script is overridden by shell-specific profiles such as `~/.bash_profile`.
# Howvever, in these dotfiles, `~/.profile` is sourced from `~/.bash_profile`
# and other shell-specific startup scripts, thus making this configuration
# available in every shell.
#
# You SHOULD NOT edit this file, as your changes here will be lost next time you
# fetch updates from the dotfiles repository. Instead, you MAY extend this
# script via the `~/local.profile` file.
