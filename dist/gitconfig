  # `git default`

  # Fetches the name of the default branch, as configured in the "origin" repo.
  #
  # This alias parses the local `origin/HEAD` reference, which points to the
  # name of the default branch in the upstream "origin" repository.
  #
  # WARNING: The `origin/HEAD` ref can become out-of-date. It is set when you
  # `git clone` the upstream repository, and is not subsequently updated - it
  # is not changed by commands like `git fetch` or `git remote update`.
  # Therefore, if the default branch is subsequently changed in the reference
  # repository, it will need to be manually updated in all the clones for
  # this alias to work correctly.
  #
  # The easiest way to update the `origin/HEAD` ref is to run the following
  # command in the local repository. This command updates local knowledge of
  # what the remote considers to be the default branch.
  #
  # ```
  # git remote set-head origin -a
  # ```
  #
  # (NOTE: Prior to Git v1.8, the above command could set the `origin/HEAD` ref
  # incorrectly, due to potential ambiguity over what is the default branch when
  # the upstream `HEAD` referenes a commit SHA that is at the tip of more than
  # one branch. This issue is now resolved in Git and we can rely on `git clone`
  # and the above command setting `origin/HEAD` correctly in clones.)
  #
  # Alternatively, you can manually edit your `.git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
  # file. If your default branch is named "dev", the contents of this file
  # should be:
  #
  # ```
  # ref: refs/remotes/origin/dev

  # `git fell ([main_branch])`
  #
  # Delete any local branches that have been merged into the default branch,
  # or that have been merged into another specified mainline branch.
  #
  # Usage:
  #
  # - `git fell`
  # - `git fell [main_branch]`
  #
  # It works like this:
  #
  # 1. Get a list of branches that have been merged into the specified branch,
  #    falling back on the default branch if there are no parameters.
  # 2. Use `grep -v` to print a list of branch names that DO NOT match the
  #    name of the target branch branch.
  # 3. Pipe this to `xargs`, which takes the standard input and executes the
  #    command `git branch --delete` for each line.
  # 4. In the event that all branches have been merged, the `branch --delete`
  #    operation will error with the message "fatal: branch name required".
  #    We can safely silence this output to stderr.
  #
  # This alias does not delete any corresponding upstream branches. This would
  # be a too-dangerous operation to automate, in case there are other shared
  # mainline tracks besides the default branch.

  # `git squash`
  #
  # Perform a `merge --squash` operation.

  # This alias is designed to work regardless of the `merge.ff` setting. A
  # simple implementation would be:
  #
  # ```
  # git merge --squash
  # ```
  #
  # However, this fails if the `merge.ff` setting has the value `false`. This
  # is equivalent to using the `--no-ff` flag and this can't be used with
  # `--squash`. That's because you're asking Git to record an explicit merge
  # commit (`--no-ff`) and create a new normal commit (`--squash`) at the same
  # time. This mix of options doesn't make sense – it is explained well here:
  # https://stackoverflow.com/a/14322024
  #
  # The `--squash` option also does not always play nicely when `merge.ff` is
  # set to `"only"`. It is possible to combine `--squash` with `--ff-only` and
  # much of the time this works perfectly well. However, with this combination,
  # if both branches have unique commits, the "fast-forward only" test will fail
  # and therefore the subsequent squash operation will not happen. This
  # constraint is rarely useful, because conflicts could be resolved manually
  # and included in the squash commit.
  #
  # The solution is to combine the `--squash` flag with the `--ff` flag. This
  # is equivalent to setting `merge.ff` to `true` which disables the check to
  # perform the merge only if a fast-forward is possible. Conflicts will need
  # to be resolved manually.
  #
  # Note, the StackOverflow answer linked below suggests using the following
  # command. This uses the `c` parameter to override the `merge.ff` config
  # temporarily. However, in testing it seems sufficient to just use the `--ff`
  # flag, which achieves the same thing.

[core]

  # core.excludesFile
  #
  # Establish a global `.gitignore` file, which will be applied to all local
  # Git repositories but never be committed to any repository. Use this to
  # include TODOs, scratch files or any other personal materials to the
  # working directories of local Git repositories without running the risk of
  # those files being committed to the repository.
  #
  excludesFile = ~/.local.gitignore

[fetch]

  # fetch.prune
  #
  # Automatically prune from the local repository any references to branches
  # and tags in the upstream repository that no longer exist there.
  #
  prune = true

[merge]

  # merge.ff
  #
  # By default, Git does not create an explicit merge commit if merging a
  # commit that is a descendant of the current HEAD commit. Instead, the tip
  # of the current branch is simply fast-forwarded to the commit being merged.
  # Otherwise an explicit merge commit is created to resolve the divergent work
  # between the source and target branches. This is equivalent to using the
  # `--ff` flag or setting `merge.ff` to `true` – but it's easier to think of
  # this as "auto" mode, it means "fast-forward if possible".
  #
  # Whe `merge.ff` is set to `false` or the `--no-ff` flag is used, an explicit
  # merge commit will be recorded every time, even if a simple fast-forward
  # operation is possible. This option can't be used with `--squash` for reasons
  # that are well explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14322024
  #
  # Finally, `merge.ff` can be set to `"only"` or the `--ff-only` flag used.
  # With this setting, Git will refuse to handle merges that cannot be simply
  # fast-forwarded. This means, where there is divergent work in the source
  # branch, the target branch must first be rebased on the source branch before
  # the merge operation will succeed.
  #
  # Squash (`--squash`) and fast-forwarding (`--ff-only`) are the two merge
  # strategies that achieve linear commit histories. It is possible to use
  # the two options together (`--squash --ff-only`). In this case, tf the source
  # branch has diverged from the target branch (so a fast-forward is not
  # possible) then the merge is rejected. Otherwise, rather than fast-forwarding,
  # all the extra commits on the target branch are squashed onto the source
  # branch, creating a new commit there.
  #
  # The following resource provides a good summary of Git merge strategies:
  # https://bit.ly/3ZZ2xOi
  #
  # My preference is to use `git merge` to perform true merges (ie creating
  # explicit merge commits, even when not needed to resolve conflicts) and to
  # use aliases such as `git squash` and `git fast-forward` to apply other
  # integration strategies.
  #
  ff = false

[pull]

  # pull.rebase
  #
  # On `git pull` operations, always rebase the current branch on top of the
  # upstream branch after fetching. This helps to maintain a clean, linear
  # commit history.
  #
  rebase = true

[push]

  # push.followTags
  #
  # Push tags with commits by default. Equivalent to `--follow-tags` option.
  #
  followTags = true

  # push.default
  #
  # By default, push branches to branches of the same name on "origin". It
  # means you can `git push` excluding the `<remote> <branch>` parameters.
  #
  default = current

  # push.autoSetupRemote
  #
  # Automatically set up branch tracking. This is equivalent to using
  # `--set-upstream` | `-u` on `git push`. This option must be used in
  # conjunction with an appropriate `default` option, eg `default = current`.
  #
  # This option is enabled since Git 2.37.
  #
  autoSetupRemote = true

[rebase]

  # rebase.autosquash
  #
  # Add the `--autosquash` option to every `rebase` operation by default. This
  # will automatically handle commit messages that are prefixed "squash!",
  # "fixup!" or "amend!", changing the rebase action from "pick" to "squash",
  # "fixup" and "fixup -C" respectively.
  #
  # (Note: "fixup -C" is the same as "fixup" except the log message of the
  # "fixup!" commit replaces the message of the target commit, rather than the
  # other way around.)
  #
  # This is a better default because interactive rebase still gives us the
  # chance to edit the action per commit, before the rebase operation proper.
  #
  # This behavior can be disabled on a case-by-case basis by adding the
  # `--no-autosquash` option to the `git rebase` command.
  #
  # https://stackoverflow.com/a/66833278

  autosquash = true

[safe]

  # safe.directory
  #
  # If your Git repositories are on an external drive, Git will consider them
  # to be owned by someone else and therefore unsafe by default. This setting

[include]

  # include.path
  #
  # Allow extensions to this base Git configuration via `~/.local.gitconfig`.
  #
  # Note, the `include.path` config MUST be maintained at the bottom of the
  # `.gitconfig` template, as the contents of the included path are injected
  # at this position and we want the included file to have the opportunity to
  # override _anything_ in the `.gitconfig` template.
