# The `~/.bashrc` file is automatically loaded whenever the `bash` command is
# used to run a script from a terminal interface, so temporarily spawing an
# interative non-login shell.
#
# This file is also sourced from `~/.bash_profile`, ensuring a consistent
# environment in all Bash terminals (ie when Bash is running in either of the
# interative login and interative non-login modes).
