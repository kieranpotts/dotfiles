# Git tools

A Windows binary for [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is bundled with this repository and the `bin/update.sh` script will create a symlink to it from your `~/bin` directory.

As long as you have `~/bin` in your PATH, you can run `lazygit` from any Git repository to open a terminal UI for the repository.
