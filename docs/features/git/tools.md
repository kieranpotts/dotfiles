# Git tools

A Windows binary for [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is bundled with this repository and the `bin/update!` script will create a symlink to it from your `~/bin` directory.

As long as you have `~/bin` in your PATH, you can run `lazygit` from any Git repository to open a terminal UI for the repository. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPLdltN7wgE) for a 15 minute to lazygit's top 15 features. For a definitive list of keybindings see the [config documentation](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md).

LazyGit's default color scheme assumes a dark theme in the terminal.
