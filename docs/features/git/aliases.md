# Git aliases

The following Git aliases provide shortcut commands for common source control operations. This table provides a short summary of each alias's API and behavior â€“ see the inline code comments in `dotfiles/gitconfig` for more comprehensive documentation.

Note: A small subset of these aliases are implemented as shell scripts that are symlinked from your `~/bin` directory, and can therefore be executed directly, eg `git-feature`.
