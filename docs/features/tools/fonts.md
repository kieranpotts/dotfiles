# Fonts

The following fonts are distributed with these dotfiles, for easy installation on different machines:

- **Hack**, which I use in my desktop code editor
- **Hack Nerd Font**, which I use for terminal interfaces

The Hack Nerd Font is the Windows-compatible version. 

The fonts are in the `./src/fonts` directory and need to be installed manually.
