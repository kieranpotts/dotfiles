# Git features

## Git config

The `.gitconfig` file installed from this repository modifies Git's default behavior in the following ways:

- `git merge` records explicit merge commits (ie `--no-ff` is the default)
- `git fetch` automatically prunes refs to non-existent upstream branches and deletes non-existent tags
- `git pull` rebases by default
- `--autosquash` rules are automatically on rebase operations
- `git push` pushed up new tags along with new commits
- Upstream branches are tracked automatically, and tracked branches are constrained to have the same names
- Opts-out of security checks for Git repositories on external storage devices (`safe.directory`)

## Git aliases

The following Git aliases provide shortcut commands for common source control operations. This table provides a short summary of each alias's API and behavior â€“ see the inline code comments in `dotfiles/gitconfig` for more comprehensive documentation.
