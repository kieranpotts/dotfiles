# Git aliases

50+ Git aliases are included. These extend Git's built-in operations, providing shortcuts for common Git workflows. 

All the Git aliases are implemented as shell scripts in the `bin` directory (which is expected to be added to your system path). 

To see what aliases are available, run the command `git aliases` (itself an alias!) in your terminal.
