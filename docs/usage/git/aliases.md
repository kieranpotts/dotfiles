# Git aliases

The following Git aliases provide shortcut commands for common source control operations. This table provides a short summary of each alias's API and behavior. For comprehensive documentation, see the inline code comments in `dist/global.gitconfig` â€“ which will be symlinked from `~/.gitconfig` when you install these dotfiles.

Note: A small subset of these aliases are implemented as shell scripts in this repository's `bin` directory. For these aliases to work, this repository's `bin` directory must be added to your system PATH environment variable.
