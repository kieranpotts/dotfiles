= Git config

The `.gitconfig` file modifies Git's default behavior in the following ways:

* `git merge` records explicit merge commits (ie `--no-ff` is the default)
* `git fetch` automatically prunes refs to non-existent upstream branches and deletes non-existent tags
* `git pull` rebases by default
* `--autosquash` rules are automatically applied on rebase operations
* `git push` pushes new tags along with new commits
* Upstream branches are tracked automatically, and tracked branches are constrained to have the same names
* Opts-out of security checks for Git repositories on external storage devices (`safe.directory`)
