# Git tools

A Windows binary for [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is bundled with this repository. As long as you have this repository's `bin` directory in your system PATH, you can run `lazygit` from any local Git repository to open a terminal UI for the repository.

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPLdltN7wgE) for a 15 minute to lazygit's top 15 features. For a definitive list of keybindings see the [config documentation](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md).

Note: LazyGit's default color scheme assumes a dark theme in the terminal.
