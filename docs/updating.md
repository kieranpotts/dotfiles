# Updating

To update your dotfiles with the latest configuration in this repository, `git pull` then re-run the `bin/update.sh` script.

There's no need to restart your terminal. From now on, whenever you update the dotfiles, you can simply call the `reload!` function, which will re-source the shell startup scripts.

```sh
reload!
```
