# Requirements

## Required dependencies

- A UNIX-like environment – [Git Bash for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) is supported
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) – the dotfiles configuration has been tested with Git v29

## Optional dependencies

- If the `oh-my-posh` utility is available on your system, it will be used to customize your terminal's prompt line. A Windows binary is bundled with this repository and, to use it, all you need to do is add this repository's `bin` directory to your system PATH environment variable. For other systems, follow [these installation instructions](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/).
