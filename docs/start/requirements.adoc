= Requirements

* A UNIX-like environment is REQUIRED. https://gitforwindows.org/[Git Bash for Windows] is supported.

* https://git-scm.com/[Git] is REQUIRED. The dotfiles configuration has been tested with Git v29.

* The full version of Vim (`/usr/bin/vim.basic`) is RECOMMENDED. The `.vimrc` file installed from this repository is not compatible with the minimalist version of Vim (`/usr/bin/vim.tiny`), which is installed by default on some Linux distros. To check which version of Vim is installed on your system, run:

[source,sh]
----
readlink -f `which vi`
----

To install the full version of Vim, `/usr/bin/vim.basic`, run:

[source,sh]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim
----
