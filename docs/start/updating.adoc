= Updating

It is easy to update your system to use the latest dotfiles configuration from this repository. There's a script for that! From this repository's root directory, run:

[source,sh]
----
sh bin/update!
----

Or, if you have added the repository's `bin` directory to your system PATH, then you can just type:

[source,sh]
----
update!
----

This script will pull the latest updates from the upstream repository and reinstall any files and symlinks as necessary.
